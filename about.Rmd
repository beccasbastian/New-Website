### "Me, PhD and R"

Enthralled by the complexity of the brain and the implications of drugs, I wanted to understand the brain in depth, as well as to ascertain my passion for research, I decided to pursue my Masterâ€™s degree, soon after I had completed my Bachelor's degree. Having little to no research background, I started my Master's degree working in a lab that was primarily focused on developmental neuroscience. Walking into it all somewhat blindly, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself in love with what I was studying and working with. So much so it had piqued my interest greatly and had landed me in the Neuroscience and Behavior, PhD program at UMASS Amherst. 

Finishing up my second year now, I have learnt a greater deal of neuroscience and scientific skills. Among those, this coding class with R has definitely added a new dimension to my scientific career as a trainee. Now, I'm ever more excited to apply some of the things I've learnt in this class to my own single-cell RNA sequencing data for the project I'm currently working on! 

p.s: I work with cortical brain organoids!
